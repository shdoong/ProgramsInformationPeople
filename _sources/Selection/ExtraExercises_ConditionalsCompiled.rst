1.1 Write code so that if "STATS 250" is in the list ``schedule`` then the string "You could be in Information Science!" is assigned to the variable ``resp``. Otherwise, the string "That's too bad." is assigned to the variable ``resp``.

7. Create a set of conditionals to determine shipping prices. Usually, it will cost you $7 to ship a large package within your state. In this case, ``location`` would be "domestic", the variable ``cost`` would be set to 7, and ``destination`` would be ``0``. If you continue to ship domestically, the cost of shipping for 1 state away is $11. For 2 states away, the cost is $15. For 3 states away, the cost is $19. If the destination is 4 or more states away, the shipping cost is fixed at $25. If you ship international the variable ``i_dest`` is 0 (within your continent), the cost is $30. Anywhere other than your continent ``i_dest`` would be set to 1 and the cost is $45. 
The variable ``location`` will have either the value "domestic" or "international". If domestic, the variable ``destination`` could have the values 0 (within the state), 1 (1 state away), 2 (2 states away), 3 (3 states away), or 4 and above (4 or more states away). If international, ``i_dest`` will either be 0 (within your continent) or 1 (out of your continent)
Use nested conditionals to help someone determine the shipping cost. Uncomment each set of variables one at a time to test.

.. activecode:: ee_ch11_07
   :tags: Selection/Nestedconditionals.rst

   #Uncomment next two lines to test domestic and 2 states away.
   #location = "domestic"
   #destination = 2

   #Uncomment next two lines to test international and not on your continent.
   #location = "international"
   #i_dest = 1

   #Uncomment next two lines to test domestic and 6 states away.
   #location = "domestic"
   #destination = 6
   =====

   from unittest.gui import TestCaseGui

   class myTests(TestCaseGui):

      def testSeven(self):
         if location == "domestic" and destination == 2:
          self.assertEqual(cost, 15, "Testing that cost is assigned to correct value.")

         elif location == "international" and i_dest == 1:
          self.assertEqual(cost, 45, "Testing that cost is assigned to correct value.")

         elif location == "domestic" and destination == 6:
          self.assertEqual(cost, 25, "Testing that cost is assigned to correct value.")

         else:
          print "Test not able to run. Check for specific values."

7.1 Say you are shipping a package that costs 5 dollars to ship usually. You want to find out the price though for shipping farther than your town. Create conditionals so that if it is shipping domestically, within the state, then the variable ``price`` is set to 5, if is one state away, then price is set to 10, otherwise it is set to 15. Otherwise, if it is not domestic, then if it is within the continent, then price is set to 40, otherwise, price is set to 60. The variable ``country`` will have "domestic" or "international" as the values, and ``d_dist`` will have an integer value for domestic state distance (0 being within the state, 1, being 1 state away, 3 as 3 states away) and ``i_dist`` will have the value of True or False to distinguish if it is within the same continent(True) or not (False). Use nested conditionals to help someone determine the shipping price. Uncomment each set of variables one at a time to test.

   #Uncomment the next 3 lines to test domestic, in-state

   #d_dist = 1

   #Uncomment the next 3 lines to test domestic, multiple states away
   #country = "domestic"
   #d_dist = 3

   #Uncomment the next 3 lines to test international, within continent
   #country = "international"
   #i_dist = True

   #Uncomment the next 3 lines to test international, not in continent

   #i_dist = False

      def testOne(self):

         elif country == "domestic" and d_dist == 1:

         elif country == "domestic" and d_dist >= 2:
            self.assertEqual(price, 15, "Testing the value of price with domestic, multiple states away")
         elif country == "international" and i_dist == True:
