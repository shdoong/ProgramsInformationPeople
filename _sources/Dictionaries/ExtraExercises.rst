1. At the halfway point during the Rio Olympics, the United States had 70 medals, Great Britain had 38 medals, China had 45 medals, Russia had 30 medals, and Germany had 17 medals. Create a dictionary assigned to the variable ``medal_count`` with the country as the key and the number of medals as the values.

1.1 Create a dictionary that keeps track of the USA's Olympic medal count. Each key of the dictionary should be the type of medal (gold, silver, bronze) and the value should be the number of medals. Currently, the USA has 33 gold medals, 17 silver, and 12 bronze. Create a dictionary named ``medals`` that reflect this.
